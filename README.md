# DataStructures in c++
This repository will have implementation of datastructures in c++

Following are the steps to run each and every functionality:
1. Go to your root directory i.e where the repository is cloned, copy Makefile.example ->  Makefile <br />
`cp Makefile.example Makefile`<br/><br/>
2. Make new-folder *build* in root of repository<br/>
`mkdir -p build`<br/><br/>
3. make respective executables by following command: <br />
  a. LinkNode: `make LinkNode-cli` <br />
  b. LinkedList: `make LinkedList-cli`<br />
  c. BinaryTree: `make BinaryTree-cli` <br />
  d. BinarySearchTree: `make BinarySearchTree-cli`<br /><br/>
4. Execute the executables which is inside *build* folder <br/>
  a. LinkNode: `/LinkNode-cli` <br />
  b. LinkedList: `./LinkedList-cli`<br />
  c. BinaryTree: `./BinaryTree-cli` <br />
  d. BinarySearchTree: `./BinarySearchTree-cli`<br /><br/>

* **Currently only test cases are been executed for respective executables**
